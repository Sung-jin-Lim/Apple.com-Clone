        1. Qualified Purchasers receive an Apple Gift Card when they purchase an eligible Mac or
        iPad at a Qualifying Location. Only one Apple Gift Card per eligible Mac or iPad per
        Qualified Purchaser. Offer subject to availability. While supplies last. Qualified
        Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Apple Gift Card off the price
        of the eligible Mac or iPad, but will be charged for all items in their cart, including the
        Apple Gift Card. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for
        Apple Card Monthly Installment (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: Qualified Purchasers
        selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option) as payment type at checkout shall receive a
        discount equal to the value of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the eligible Mac or
        iPad. This will result in one ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the eligible iPad or
        Mac discounted by the instant credit, and a second ACMI installment plan over 12 months for
        the full price of the Apple Gift Card. The total combined amount charged over the two
        separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible
        Product. Separately, Qualified Purchasers will receive and be charged for the Apple Gift
        Card in the amount of the applicable discount off the eligible Mac or iPad. ACMI is subject
        to credit approval and credit limit. Variable APRs for Apple Card other than ACMI range from
        12.49% to 23.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of July 1, 2022. If you choose the
        pay‑in‑full or one‑time‑payment option for an ACMI‑eligible purchase instead of choosing
        ACMI as the payment option at checkout, that purchase will be subject to the variable APR
        assigned to your Apple Card. Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI transactions and
        are subject to your standard purchase APR. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement at
        https://www.goldmansachs.com/terms-and-conditions/Apple-Card-Customer-Agreement.pdf for more
        information. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following special
        stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs;
